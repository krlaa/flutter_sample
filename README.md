## Setup

- Once the gitpod container loads then run the command:
```
flutter run -d web-server
```
- The command will run and give an output saying that the project is being hosted on localhost:# (localhost port #)
- ![Access the port view](https://i.ibb.co/L9zKDRK/indication.png)
- ![Open port in simple browser](https://i.ibb.co/mqd68v9/indication2.png)
- *This is is a flutter web project so there will be no hot reload, to test the app with changes press r in the console/terminal and then press the reload button on the simple browser tab.*


### Mobile with remote adb

###### Check your mobile lan ip and feel free to use your own port configuration

```
  SMARTPHONE_LOCAL_IP = 192.168.0.10 (LAN IP)
  INTERNAL_PORT = 5555
```

###### [Localhost command] Run the following command to switch adb on your device to work over the network using the internal port

```
  adb tcpip INTERNAL_PORT
```

###### [Localhost command] Check adb connection from localhost

```
  adb connect SMARTPHONE_LOCAL_IP:INTERNAL_PORT
```

###### [Localhost command] Starts ngrok tcp forwarding to your mobile or if you prefer you can forward a chosen port on your router to the mobile

- Ngrok describes itself as “expose a local server behind a NAT or firewall to the internet.”, making our lives easier.

```
  ngrok tcp SMARTPHONE_LOCAL_IP:INTERNAL_PORT
```

###### [Gitpod command] Connect from your Gitpod to your localhost for debugging

```
  adb connect NGROK_ADDRESS:NGROK_PORT
  flutter run -d NGROK_ADDRESS:NGROK_PORT
```
